# Small DataSet CNN Network
## Contains:
This Repository consist of Training a CNN model on a Small data set from scratch, then to achive the highest accuracy possible, using "Generator", applying "augmentation", "drop-out" & even used "pre-trained convent" for "Fast Feature Extraction". Every step is completely
guided in detail!
## Trained Networks:
All the Networks that have been trained/fit during the whole procedure mentioned in the notebook are given in this repository! some of the models are large files so I have to compress it.
1. "cats_and_dogs_small_1.h5" it has the accuracy of 81.94% and validation accuracy of 70.10%.
2. "cats_and_dogs_Large_1.h5" it has the accuracy of 79.12% and validation accuracy of 79.10%.
3. "cats_and_dogs_FFE_1.h5" it has the accuracy of 97.31% and validatioon accuracy of 90.00%.This network is trained under the "Fast feature extraction" of VGG16 model, it has a very high accuracy
More details about the model is mentioned at the very end of notebook!
